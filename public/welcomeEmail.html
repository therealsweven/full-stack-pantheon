    <h3>Dear <b>${recipient.business_name},</b></h3>
    <p>
      We would like to welcome you to the Mercury POS community! We really hope
      that you enjoy using our POS system. When setting up your business in the
      POS, use the login id <b>'admin'</b> to log in. This will give you access
      to all admin settings. We strongly recommend changing or deleting the
      admin profile after you have added at least one other employee with
      manager privileges.
      <br />
      If you ever have any questions or issues when using the product, feel free
      to send your concerns to this email address. Thank you for your business,
      and have a wonderful day!
      <br /><br />
      -Mercury POS
